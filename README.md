UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Tidy Dataset
==========

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

run_analysis.R will create a tidy data set from data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
