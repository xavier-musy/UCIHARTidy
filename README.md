UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Tidy Dataset
==========

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 

run_analysis.R will create a tidy data set from UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset [1] collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Specifically, run_analysis.R will download:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

And extract it a directory named Data.  

A tidy data set will be saved in the Data directory, as TidyData.txt.

The [Code book](CodeBook.md) details the tidy data.
